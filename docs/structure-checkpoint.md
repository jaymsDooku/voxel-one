# Structure review fix checkpoint

Current published base: 3f7ab54c500e77b664312a780f39fdf4bed901d9, PR #76.
Review base: b1d7b8d796b97a87a3d63bb08baf2bb9746b8ca6.

Review collision finding is being fixed. Both authorities now call shared
StructureOccupancy before changing models, edits, geometry or saves. This uses
live city frames and current player poses under the authority lock. Offline F12
placement/undo receive a live player supplier from Main. Nonempty resulting cells
reserve the entire cell; empty undo cells may safely clear geometry around bodies.

Four new offline/server authority tests passed, including horses and players
entering after staging, no partial geometry/dependencies/save, retry after leaving,
and guarded restoration versus safe empty undo. Existing structure/fractional/model
focused regressions passed. Exact totals/commands will be in the review-fix report.
Fresh native workflow (including player collision rejection capture) and 32-session
functional regression are running. Raw logs and synthetic profiles stay in target/.
No earlier CI is claimed for these edits. Hosted checks need controller publication
once local tests/media are complete. Full city/max, physical GPU, shaped-network
performance qualification and stable rollout remain gated.

DeepSeek review task 3d9470ff-84f8-4f41-b8bb-74b2c48dd252 failed; explicitly resolved
self. Independent local inspection confirmed validation precedes mutation, server
city advancement shares the authority lock, and undo uses the same commit guard.

## Completed local validation for collision fix

32 focused tests passed (five new collision tests, including production TLS
protocol). Compile/test commands are recorded in structure-collision-validation.json.
32-session functional regression passed in 345.913 s; 50 ms movement cadence,
production authentication throttle preserved. This is single-host functional load,
not reference distributed/network qualification.
Playtest: python3 deploy/run_structure_playtest.py --display "$DISPLAY" passed on
llvmpipe with isolated synthetic profile. Live-player rejection message and placed
world captures inspected. Four rotations, cancellation, undo, repeat placement,
restart, inventory and model editor regression checks passed. The first harness
attempt failed because it mutated a returned position copy; corrected setup rerun
passed. No production failure was concealed.

Fresh sanitized media, report and source manifest are in dashboard/evidence,
pending controller publication. Native source manifest hash:
665d25b1bb96d248b7fdc279db5b8042ce34b049eb27bfbba5df103a8302def9.
No source changed after tests. No deleted files or unmerged paths; diff check passed.
Next: controller feature_validation handoff for revised source CI, then inspect
exact-head hosted summaries and published media before ready. Previous-head CI
remains historical. Full qualification and stable rollout remain gated.
