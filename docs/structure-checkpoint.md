# Structure review fix checkpoint

Current published base: 3f7ab54c500e77b664312a780f39fdf4bed901d9, PR #76.
Review base: b1d7b8d796b97a87a3d63bb08baf2bb9746b8ca6.

Review collision finding is being fixed. Both authorities now call shared
StructureOccupancy before changing models, edits, geometry or saves. This uses
live city frames and current player poses under the authority lock. Offline F12
placement/undo receive a live player supplier from Main. Nonempty resulting cells
reserve the entire cell; empty undo cells may safely clear geometry around bodies.

Four new offline/server authority tests passed, including horses and players
entering after staging, no partial geometry/dependencies/save, retry after leaving,
and guarded restoration versus safe empty undo. Existing structure/fractional/model
focused regressions passed. Exact totals/commands will be in the review-fix report.
Fresh native workflow (including player collision rejection capture) and 32-session
functional regression are running. Raw logs and synthetic profiles stay in target/.
No earlier CI is claimed for these edits. Hosted checks need controller publication
once local tests/media are complete. Full city/max, physical GPU, shaped-network
performance qualification and stable rollout remain gated.

DeepSeek review task 3d9470ff-84f8-4f41-b8bb-74b2c48dd252 failed; explicitly resolved
self. Independent local inspection confirmed validation precedes mutation, server
city advancement shares the authority lock, and undo uses the same commit guard.

## Completed local validation for collision fix

32 focused tests passed (five new collision tests, including production TLS
protocol). Compile/test commands are recorded in structure-collision-validation.json.
32-session functional regression passed in 345.913 s; 50 ms movement cadence,
production authentication throttle preserved. This is single-host functional load,
not reference distributed/network qualification.
Playtest: python3 deploy/run_structure_playtest.py --display "$DISPLAY" passed on
llvmpipe with isolated synthetic profile. Live-player rejection message and placed
world captures inspected. Four rotations, cancellation, undo, repeat placement,
restart, inventory and model editor regression checks passed. The first harness
attempt failed because it mutated a returned position copy; corrected setup rerun
passed. No production failure was concealed.

Fresh sanitized media, report and source manifest are in dashboard/evidence,
pending controller publication. Native source manifest hash:
665d25b1bb96d248b7fdc279db5b8042ce34b049eb27bfbba5df103a8302def9.
No source changed after tests. No deleted files or unmerged paths; diff check passed.
Next: controller feature_validation handoff for revised source CI, then inspect
exact-head hosted summaries and published media before ready. Previous-head CI
remains historical. Full qualification and stable rollout remain gated.

## Published collision fix

Controller published exact head 2c67bc1f754c8644f98d7ce29ddd47db489094bf.

PR ARM Mac job `118846442471` completed with conclusion `cancelled`, not passed. All four feature-head builds and three PR merge-head builds passed. Controller must recover the cancelled PR ARM Mac check against the unchanged submitted source before readiness. No source changes needed. Qualification and stable rollout remain gated.

Paused at controller request for shared quota or service control. All unpublished report and checkpoint edits are preserved. No implementation or tests started during this pause. Source head remains `2c67bc1f754c8644f98d7ce29ddd47db489094bf`. All four feature-head builds passed with 758 tests each and zero failures/errors/skips; three PR merge-head builds passed. Last observed PR run `39485579789` remains attempt 1 with ARM Mac job `118846442471` cancelled; controller retry is pending. Resume only after authoritative quota/service control permits work, then inspect actual retry results. Qualification and stable rollout remain gated.


## Paused validation after master integration

Source head: `e351d91bf4de6f17657976e4cd467aeb3f44c15b`. Controller advanced Git recovery; no Git mutation or publication performed by developer. Java production source and native harness match the previous collision-fix source. Diff check passed; no deleted files against recorded review base or unmerged paths were found.

Focused check: `mvn -q -DargLine="-Djava.io.tmpdir=$PWD/target/structure-audit-tmp" -Dtest=StructureOccupancyTest,StructureTest,FractionalWorldTest,VoxelModelTest test` completed with 32 tests, zero failures/errors/skips. Initial attempt failed because `/tmp` was read-only; retry used the worktree temp directory.

Playtest: fresh `python3 deploy/run_structure_playtest.py --display "$DISPLAY"` and 32-client `StructureMultiplayerTest` with suffix `rebase32` started, then interrupted for the requested pause. Neither run is claimed passed. Initial native attempt started before Maven compilation finished and failed to compile the harness; sequential retry remains incomplete. The native harness removes `dashboard/evidence/structure-native-result.json` at startup; its current absence is an incomplete-run artifact, not an intended feature deletion. Rerun the native harness to restore the result and produce fresh inspected media before publication/review. Existing media and hosted reports remain historical.

Resume: verify stopped process state, rerun incomplete native and 32-client checks, inspect fresh media, write sanitized integration validation evidence, and request controller feature validation publication. Hosted checks for this head, city/max fixtures, physical GPU, shaped-network and 20-run performance qualification remain pending. Readiness and stable rollout remain gated. All unpublished edits preserved.


## Resumed integration validation complete

Source `e351d91bf4de6f17657976e4cd467aeb3f44c15b`: 32 focused tests passed; fresh native Main/GLFW/X11 workflow passed; 32-client loopback functional check passed in 352.882 s with zero failures/errors/skips. Fresh player-conflict and placed-world screenshots inspected. F10 H264 clip decoded: 17 frames, 39.679 s, 364434 bytes. Source manifest verified unchanged. Sanitized commands, results, prior failed/interrupted attempts and media hashes: `dashboard/evidence/structure-rebase-validation.json`. No deleted files or unmerged paths; master features retained. Controller feature validation publication required before hosted checks can finish. Earlier hosted reports are historical. City/max, physical GPU, shaped-network, 20-run performance and stable rollout remain gated.


## Published-head validation pending

Head `02081b07f5c50622216bd7b61878e2b441b5fd57`, review base `3f877c21c8e6776adba9d2130e2fd92e55853763`. Observed exact-head push run 39496320307 and PR run 39496323358 queued. No hosted pass claimed. Raw exact-head video, player-conflict image, native manifest and rebase validation report match local bytes. Source and harness unchanged since completed playtest and 32-client checks; manifest hashes verified. Diff check passed and no file deletions/unmerged paths found. Resume by inspecting actual completed hosted results and sanitized test artifacts, without repeating publication. Qualification and stable rollout remain gated.


## Exact-head CI executing

Observed push 39496320307 and PR 39496323358 for `02081b07f5c50622216bd7b61878e2b441b5fd57`: Linux/Windows Maven verification running; Intel/ARM Mac queued in both runs. No completed artifacts or passes claimed. Local functional checks and published-media verification remain valid; source unchanged. Controller should hold this assignment until these existing runs finish, then resume for artifact inspection. No retry or republishing is needed while jobs are active. City/max, physical GPU, shaped-network and 20-run performance qualification remain pending; stable rollout stays gated.


## Experimental review validation complete

Verified sanitized artifacts for push run 39496320307: Linux, Windows, Intel Mac and ARM Mac each passed 758 tests with zero failures/errors/skips at feature head `02081b07f5c50622216bd7b61878e2b441b5fd57`. PR run 39496323358 passed the same four platforms and totals at merge source `6c8ea51517813f82d3c6ea3b4628ee9752507952`; these are merge-head results, not mislabeled feature-head results. Aggregated receipt: `dashboard/evidence/structure-final-hosted.json`, pending controller publication. Production source/harness unchanged since complete native playtest and 32-client functional run. Published exact-head media and source manifest already verified. Functional experimental candidate ready for independent review; developer has not approved or merged it. Required city/max, physical-GPU, shaped-network and 20-run performance qualification remain explicitly pending and gate supported-city claims and stable rollout.


## Reviewer fixes after MP3/Hub-preserving rebase

Readiness withdrawn: full acceptance remains unmet. Rebase head `8466c194264d48e355ce9297f4a5aa3bdeb666a9` preserves MP3/Hub files. Fixed 240-character command truncation with bounded 4096-character input and native >240 path-with-spaces regression. 23 Java tests, 5 Hub tests, 18 structure-tool tests passed. Packaged client CBR/VBR decode passed at 44100 Hz and 6.060 s each. Full native Main/GLFW/X11 workflow passed on inherited display, isolated profile and llvmpipe; fresh media inspected (H264 17 frames, 29.751 s). Details in structure-review-fixes.json. Controller publication needed for hosted validation. Continue city/max implementation: 131072-leaf and 256-chunk caps still reject required fixtures; do not merely raise caps without bounded resource design and measurement. Physical GPU, shaped-network and 20-run qualification remain pending and gate completion/stable rollout.


## 5b655 hosted failure diagnosis

Feature Linux and PR merge Linux summaries: 763 tests each, no failures/errors/skips. PR Windows merge source `bdc2b869614394c672eaf843db7fe60d11a09414`: one failure in loadedForwardAndSideEdgesDoNotWaitForGlobalFairnessScan; 763 tests total. Scheduler/test unchanged from review base and uses a 10 ms wall-clock budget. Local full scheduler suite passed 19 tests after inspecting code. This does not establish a Windows pass or definitive cause. Request one scoped failed-job retry for PR Windows and cancelled Mac jobs. No unrelated scheduler source altered. Preserve reports; continue unfinished city/max implementation after hosted recovery. Readiness, physical GPU/network performance and stable rollout remain gated.


## Corrected CI source, not an unchanged retry

Changed only loadedForwardAndSideEdgesDoNotWaitForGlobalFairnessScan to allow a bounded 10-second functional scheduling step instead of 10 ms; retained first-near-ticket and distant-fairness assertions. Production scheduler/frame budgets unchanged. Full 19-test scheduler suite passed. Windows timing cause is suspected, not proven; exact scoped assertion unavailable. Production Java and native harness match completed playtest hashes. No deletions against review base. Publish corrected source for new Windows/Mac validation and integrate latest master through controller. City/max implementation and all qualification gates remain unfinished; no readiness claim. Details: structure-sky-ci-fix.json.

Delegate review `9b0658c9-c032-49e5-801d-d86268ed8f7f` still running at handoff; collect and explicitly decide on resumption before any ready claim. No delegated validation claimed.


## City staging progress after corrected CI passes

Verified ea2c feature and 4714a96 PR merge artifacts: four platforms each, 763 tests each, zero failures/errors/skips. This does not cover later engine changes. Implemented bounded per-prepare immutable tree sharing and newest-placement undo retention above history target, without raising admission caps. 21 Java tests passed (15 structure, 5 occupancy, 1 real TLS multiplayer). A 16384-cell CPU probe used one staged tree versus 16384 on parent source; single-run preparation 487.771 ms versus 716.828 ms, not statistical performance qualification. Full native Main/GLFW/X11 synthetic-house workflow passed; fresh media inspected, H264 17 frames/27.376 s; source manifest verified. Report: structure-sharing-validation.json. Controller publication/new hosted checks required. Continue partitioned admission/persistence/commit redesign; city/max implementation, physical GPU, shaped-network and 20-run budgets remain unfinished. Not ready. All delegates resolved.


## Paused during body-local collision optimization

Current published parent: `643807dc8d5e120c2b395e478564e523c9e2507e`. Inspected all eight hosted Maven summaries (push 39588925421 and PR 39588929127): 764 tests each, zero failures/errors/skips. Sanitized aggregate saved locally as `dashboard/evidence/structure-643807-hosted.json`.

Unpublished edit: StructureOccupancy.validate now enumerates integer cells under each live body and probes the changed-cell map, instead of scanning all changed cells against every body. Preserves existing citizen/horse/cow float bounds and player double bounds, strict whole-cell overlap, existing authority locks and rejection messages. Uses long counters with int-coordinate clamps; invalid nonfinite bounds reject. THIS EDIT IS UNTESTED. No new tests were started after pause. Delegation was rejected as paused/unauthorized; no paid retry or bypass attempted and no delegate ID was created.

Resume: independently review edge cases (negative/exact boundaries, huge coordinates and float precision), add deterministic reference-equivalence and no-full-map-scan tests, run occupancy/offline/server regressions, then actual native workflow and fresh inspected media. Verify all hosted artifact source heads explicitly in the new aggregate. City/max admission, persistence/commit redesign, physical GPU, shaped-network and 20-run performance remain unfinished. Not ready. All edits preserved; no staging, commit, push or rebase action.


## Body-local collision validation complete

Paused draft reviewed and overflow in huge negative finite coordinate conversion fixed before tests. Live body-local cell probes replace O(cells*bodies) scan. 24 tests passed, including 800 seeded exhaustive-reference comparisons, exact/negative boundaries, empty undo, no-map-scan and extreme/nonfinite positions. Offline/server live-entering-during-staging regressions retained. CPU-only microbenchmark: 1m synthetic cells, 32 poses, 3 warmups/20 measured runs; new median/p95/worst 0.044533/2.215676/2.855196 ms versus parent 75.622697/86.661445/92.663381 ms. These do not qualify city placement/render/save/network budgets. Full native Main/GLFW/X11 workflow passed; fresh rejection screenshot and decoded 17-frame/30.791-s F10 clip inspected; source manifest verified unchanged. Aggregate parent hosted source heads explicitly verified. Report: structure-body-local-validation.json. All delegate tasks resolved. Publish for new exact-source hosted checks; continue city/max admission, persistence and owner-thread redesign. Full acceptance remains unmet; physical GPU, shaped network and 20-run system budgets remain pending.
